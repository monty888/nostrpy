# nostrpy
some stuff written in python for the nostr protocol  

- relay, relay implementation - basically working not really tested
- client, client pool - classes that implement the client side part of the nostr protocol for apps to be built on - very rough but working
- cmd_chat, example currently 1-1 cli chat app, partially implemented
- mirror_relay, mirror nostr events from one set of nostr relays to another
